## Code review by Jay Adamo

### Considerations to keep in mind while doing a code review:

- Can you follow the code flow/layout?
- Can you understand the logic/reasoning for what it is doing?
- Could you build with (import and use) or extend on it (as a developer adding more to the codebase)?

### Review
__example_module__.py: A great variety of class functions and library imports. Code is very tidy and flows well. The only issue I would think is that there is too much going on in one file but if you got it to load, terrific!

__init__.py: Clear spacing, a ton of libraries which will be great for future changes/additions to the code. 

test.py: Again, very neat and tidy code, well spaced.

### Overall
Looking at all of the code I could follow the flow and understand the reasoning. The code can definitely be imported and built upon with libraries already included. The only thing lacking is creativity as the majority of the code resembles class examples. However, there was a lot of code, it was all clearly written following PEP8 standards, and the addition of all of the libraries will be great for future additions.

### SCORE: 3
