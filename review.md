## Code review by Jay Adamo

### Considerations to keep in mind while doing a code review:

- Can you follow the code flow/layout?
- Can you understand the logic/reasoning for what it is doing?
- Could you build with (import and use) or extend on it (as a developer adding more to the codebase)?

### Review
__example_module__.py: A great variety of class functions and library imports. Code is very tidy and flows well. The only issue I would think is that there is too much going on in one file but if you got it to load, terrific!

__init__.py: Clear spacing, a ton of libraries which will be great for future changes/additions to the code.
